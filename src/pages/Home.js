      Mathematics is one of the common subjects that we study since our
      childhood. It is generally used in our daily life. Every person needs to
      learn some basics of it. Even counting money also includes math. Every
      work is linked with math in some way or the other. A person who does math
      is called a Mathematician.
      <br />
      Mathematics can be divided into two parts. The first is Pure mathematics,
      and the second is Applied mathematics. In Pure mathematics, we need to
      study the basic concept and structures of mathematics. But, on the other
      side, Applied mathematics involves the application of mathematics to solve
      problems that arise in various areas,(e.g.), science, engineering, and so
      on.
      <br />
      One couldnâ€™t imagine the world without math. Math makes our life
      systematic, and every invention involves math. No matter what action a
      person is doing, he should know some basic maths. Every profession
      involves maths. Our present-day world runs on computers, and even computer
      runs with the help of maths. Every development that happens requires math.

      Math is complicated to learn, and one needs to focus and concentrate more.
      Math is logical sometimes, and the logic needs to be derived out. Maths
      make our life easier and more straightforward. Math is considered to be
      challenging because it consists of many formulas that have to be learned,
      and many symbols and each symbol generally has its significance.
      <br />
      Some ofthe advantages of Math in our daily life
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Managing Money: Counting money and calculating simple interest, compound
        interest includes the usage of mathematics. Profit and loss are also
        computed using maths. Anything related to maths contains maths.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cooking: Maths is even used in cooking as estimating the number of
        ingredients that have to be used is calculated in numbers. Proportions
        also include maths.
      </li>
      <li>
        Home modelling: Calculating the area is essential in the construction of
        the home or home modelling. The size is also measured using maths. Even
        heights are also measured using maths.
      </li>
      <li>
        Travelling: Distance between two places and time taken to travel also
        includes maths. The amount of time taken revolves around maths. Almost
        every work is related to maths in some way or another. Maths contains
        some conditions that need to be followed, and maths has several formulas
        that have to be learned to become a mathematician.
